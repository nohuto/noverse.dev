Possible uBO configuration (which I currently use):

uBlock Origin Filters:

> https://github.com/yokoffing/filterlists  
> https://filterlists.com/

Further extensions you may want:

> https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin-development/cgbcahbpdhpcegmbfconppldiemgcoii?pli=1 (uBlock Origin development build)

uBlock origin was removed from the chrome extension store, but you can still add it via the link (may be removed soon).

> https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/duckduckgo-privacy-essent/bkdgflcldnnnapblkhphbgpggdiikppg (search engine)  

You can get my minimal configuration for the search engine via the `nohutoddg` passphrase.

## Flags - Privacy, Security & Performance

You could also add command lines, instead of applying some of them via `brave://flags`, but you won't see the changes if the command line is also available in `brave://flags`. Verify them by entering `brave://version` and looking into the '**Command Line**' section, you should see all commands, which are currently used there.

How do I use command line flags in Brave?
> https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044860011-How-Do-I-Use-Command-Line-Flags-in-Brave  

The following are flags, which can be changed, by opening `brave://flags` and pasting the name into the search bar. Some are personal preference, some may disable features, which you want, so read the desc of the flag, before changing it.

Since Brave comes with crypo features, Leo AI etc. by default it's recommended to disable these features via flags (which completely hides them from the UI).

### Experimental Flags

The following are flags, which also can be useful, but youll have to test them yourself. Make sure to read the desc of the flag! If you experience issues, revert them to their default value. Using the flags listed above is already enough, this is just for people, who want to test more. If you dont know much about such settings, leave them, as for example `enable-waitable-swap-chain` can cause frame drops, if changing it to max 1 frame.
