[Brave](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/releases) is my secondary browser which I use for streaming content that requires [widevine](https://chromium.woolyss.com/#widevine) since it supports it natively.

## App Settings

### Customize New Tab Page

Click on the gear in a new tab to get to this part.

### Privacy and security

- Security
  - `Use secure DNS`: On (I would recommend to use [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/en/help/dns-over-https-and-dns-over-tls#specifications)/[Quad9](https://quad9.net/news/blog/doh-with-quad9-dns-servers/#additional-information) or set up your own private DNS via [AdGuard](https://adguard-dns.io/) - see [win-config/network/encrypted-dns/#providers-compared](https://www.noverse.dev/docs/win-config/network/encrypted-dns/#providers-compared) & [win-config/network/encrypted-dns/#note-for-ios-users](https://www.noverse.dev/docs/win-config/network/encrypted-dns/#note-for-ios-users))

## Flags

We will use flags to disable some of the bloat features which are enabled by default in Brave, e.g. wallet/AI/crypto.

You could also add flags via the [CL](https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044860011-How-Do-I-Use-Command-Line-Flags-in-Brave) instead of applying some of them using `brave://flags`. Verify it by entering `brave://version` and checking the '**Command Line**' section.

| Flag | Description | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `brave-v8-jitless-mode` | Enable V8 jitless mode when optimizations are disabled. V8 runs in jitless mode which reduces performance but improves security. This does not affect all pages. | Enabled |
| `brave-wallet-zcash` | Zcash support for native Brave Wallet | Disabled |

| `brave-compact-horizontal-tabs` | Reduces the height of horizontal tabs | Enabled (preference) |

## Disabling Brave Services/Tasks

```powershell
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\brave" -Name "Start" -PropertyType DWord -Value 4 -Force
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\BraveElevationService" -Name "Start" -PropertyType DWord -Value 4 -Force
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\bravem" -Name "Start" -PropertyType DWord -Value 4 -Force
Get-ScheduledTask -TaskPath '\' | ? { $_.TaskName -like 'BraveSoftwareUpdate*'  } | % { Disable-ScheduledTask -TaskName $_.TaskName -TaskPath '\' }
```
`BraveSoftwareUpdateTaskUser*`: Keeps your BraveSoftware software up to date. If this task is disabled or stopped, your BraveSoftware software will not be kept up to date, meaning security vulnerabilities that may arise cannot be fixed and features may not work. This task uninstalls itself when there is no BraveSoftware software using it.
