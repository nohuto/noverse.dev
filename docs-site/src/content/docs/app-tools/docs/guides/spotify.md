## [Automating App Configuration](https://github.com/nohuto/app-tools/blob/main/assets/Spotify-Config.ps1)

Spotify stores most desktop settings locally in the `prefs` files. Global app settings: `%APPDATA%\Spotify\prefs`, per-account settings: `%APPDATA%\Spotify\Users\<autologin.username>-user\prefs`.

These settings aren't written down anywhere so I deciced to write them down to make it possible to automate the configuration.

See [Spotify-Config.ps1](https://github.com/nohuto/app-tools/blob/main/assets/Spotify-Config.ps1) for a possible automated configuration. You can easily modify it adding/removing lines from `$user`/`$global` using the information below.

### Global Settings

```ini
; Start a private session (start time)
; Convert it using [DateTimeOffset]::FromUnixTimeSeconds(<number>)
core.incognito.start_time=<number>
