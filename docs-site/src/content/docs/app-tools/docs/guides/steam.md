## Local Config Files

[`Steam-Config.ps1`](https://github.com/nohuto/app-tools/blob/main/assets/Steam-Config.ps1) parses localconfig, then adds/edits the keys/blocks (a `.bak` file gets created in case you want to revert the changes). The order doesn't seem to be important means that the script adds missing keys/blocks to the buttom.

You can edit the settings the script applies via `$settings`, to do so you need to know if a key is in the root block or if it's in a specific block. The script currently applies several settings which are listed in [#app-settings](/docs/app-tools/docs/guides/steam/#app-settings).

- `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\config\config.vdf`
- `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\config\loginusers.vdf`: stores users/login behaviours (offline mode, remember password, auto login, etc.)
- `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\config\libraryfolders.vdf`: stores library paths
- `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\<AccountID>\config\localconfig.vdf`: saves most steam settings
- `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\<AccountID>\<AppID>\remote\sharedconfig.vdf`: saves per-app/SteamUI config (and toast settings)

Means to automate the configuration we only use `localconfig.vdf`/`sharedconfig.vdf`. It's not possible to configure all settings from [#app-settings](/docs/app-tools/docs/guides/steam/#app-settings) via the local files/registry but some of them.

## Steam CEF

`umpdc.dll` checks Steam's `RunningAppID` to see whether a game is running and terminates `steamwebhelper.exe` (runs CEF UI) while one is active. This can be used to avoid SteamWebHelper processes during gaming ("CEF is Chromium Embedded Framework, the browser engine Steam uses for web-based UI parts like the store, community, chat/friends, and other embedded web views."). Install it using the command below (replace `v5.0.2` with `v5.0.1` if x86 machine).

```powershell
$steam = (gp "HKCU:\Software\Valve\Steam").SteamPath
iwr "https://github.com/Aetopia/NoSteamWebHelper/releases/download/v5.0.2/umpdc.dll" -OutFile (Join-Path $steam "umpdc.dll")
```
