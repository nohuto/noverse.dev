Clean your folder with:
```cmd
Dism.exe /online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup
```
or
```
Dism.exe /online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup /ResetBase
```
, if you want to remove all superseded versions of every component in the component store. (no need, if there aren't any)

}
```
The value doesn't exist on more recent versions.
