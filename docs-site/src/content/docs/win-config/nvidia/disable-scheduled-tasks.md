Disables NVIDIA scheduled tasks recusively. All 3 tasks no longer seem to be created, I'll leave this option for now.

`NvTmRep.exe` = NVIDIA crash and telemetry reporter  
`NvTmMon` = Sends data on logon, then in a 1H interval  
`NvTmRepOnLogon` = Sends data on logon  
`NvTmRep` = Sends data at 12:25PM daily

```powershell
["NvTmRep_*", "NvTmRepOnLogon*", "NvTmMon_*"]
```
