Audio enhancements are software based sound processing features that change or improve how playback or microphone audio sounds on a device. In general, they are used to improve clarity, balance volume, reduce noise, boost certain frequencies, or simulate spatial/surround effects, depending on the device and driver, but they can also cause audio issues etc., which is why you may want to disable them.

System effects are implemented as audio processing objects (APOs) that can be inserted into an audio stream. APOs are software modules that perform audio processing functions such as volume control and format conversion. Disabling the system effects for an endpoint device enables the associated stream to pass through the APOs unmodified.* | `1` = Off, `0` = On |
