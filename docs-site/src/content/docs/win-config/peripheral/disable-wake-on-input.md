```bat
powercfg /devicequery wake_programmable
powercfg /devicequery wake_armed
```
`powercfg /devicequery wake_programmable` -> devices that are user-configurable to wake the system from a sleep state
`powercfg /devicequery wake_armed` -> currently configured to wake the system from any sleep state

```bat
powercfg /devicedisablewake device
```
Disables the device (replace '*Device*' with the device name) from waking the system from any sleep state.

`WakeOnInputDeviceTypes` probably handles wake on input behavior for all input devices - each bit represents a input device type? Since `\SYSTEM\INPUT` only queries two values I'll add the second on in here.
```
\Registry\Machine\SYSTEM\INPUT : UnDimOnInputDeviceTypes
\Registry\Machine\SYSTEM\INPUT : WakeOnInputDeviceTypes
```
`UnDimOnInputDeviceTypes` probably refers to any dimmed elemets (pure speculation)? Disabling it wouldn't make sense. Values named `ButtonsAsVKeys` & `HardwareButtonsAsVKeys` may exist in `SYSTEM\\INPUT\\BUTTONS`, but I haven't looked further into it.

Default values:
```c
WakeOnInputDeviceTypes = 46
UnDimOnInputDeviceTypes = -1  // 0xFFFFFFFF
```
