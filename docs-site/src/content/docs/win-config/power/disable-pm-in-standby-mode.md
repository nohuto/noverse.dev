This policy setting specifies that power management is disabled when the machine enters connected standby mode.
- If this policy setting is enabled, Windows Connection Manager doesn't manage adapter radios to reduce power consumption when the machine enters connected standby mode.
- If this policy setting isn't configured or is disabled, power management is enabled when the machine enters connected standby mode.

`Disable Modern Standby`:
```c
"HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Power"; 
    "MSDisabled" = 1; // PopModernStandbyDisabled

"HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Power\\ModernSleep";
    "EnabledActions" = 0; // PopAggressiveStandbyActionsRegValue 
    "EnableDsNetRefresh" = 0; // PopEnableDsNetRefresh 
```

| Power state | ACPI state | Description | 
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Working | *S0* | The system is fully usable. Hardware components that aren't in use can save power by entering a lower power state. | 
| Sleep (Modern Standby) | *S0* low-power idle | Some SoC systems support a low-power idle state known as [Modern Standby](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/modern-standby). In this state, the system can very quickly switch from a low-power state to high-power state in response to hardware and network events. **Note:** SoC systems that support Modern Standby don't use *S1-S3*. | 
| Sleep | *S1*<br> *S2*<br> *S3* | The system appears to be off. The amount of power consumed in states *S1-S3* is less than *S0* and more than *S4*. *S3* consumes less power than *S2*, and *S2* consumes less power than *S1*. Systems typically support one of these three states, not all three.<br><br> In states *S1-S3*, volatile memory is kept refreshed to maintain the system state. Some components remain powered so the computer can wake from input from the keyboard, LAN, or a USB device.<br><br> *Hybrid sleep*, used on desktops, is where a system uses a hibernation file with *S1-S3*. The hibernation file saves the system state in case the system loses power while in sleep.<br><br> **Note:** SoC systems that support Modern Standby don't use *S1-S3*. | 
| Hibernate | *S4* | The system appears to be off. Power consumption is reduced to the lowest level. The system saves the contents of volatile memory to a hibernation file to preserve system state. Some components remain powered so the computer can wake from input from the keyboard, LAN, or a USB device. The working context can be restored if it's stored on nonvolatile media.<br><br> *Fast startup* is where the user is logged off before the hibernation file is created. This allows for a smaller hibernation file, more appropriate for systems with less storage capabilities. | 
| Soft off | *S5* | The system appears to be off. This state is comprised of a full shutdown and boot cycle. | 
| Mechanical off | *G3* | The system is completely off and consumes no power. The system returns to the working state only after a full reboot. |
