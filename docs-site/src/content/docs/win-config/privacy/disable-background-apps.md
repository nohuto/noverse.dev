## Suboption

`Disable Background Task Host`:  
Renames `backgroundTaskHost.exe` to prevent UWP background tasks from running (notifications, live tiles, background sync). Use only if you do not rely on Store apps.

When the system is in Modern Standby, desktop apps are suspended and UWP apps are typically suspended, but background tasks created by UWP apps are allowed to execute. `backgroundTaskHost.exe` is the host for those tasks.
