Windows adds a hidden tag called [`Zone.Identifier`](https://www.cyberengage.org/post/unveiling-file-origins-the-role-of-alternate-data-streams-ads-zone-identifier-in-forensic-inve) to files downloaded from the internet. This tag (also known as MotW) stores info about the file's origin and helps apply security warnings, see files including the tag with:
```powershell
gi * -Stream "Zone.Identifier" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

## ZoneID Data

**ZoneID** (`HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Zones`) - number indicating the security zone the file came from:
`0` – Local machine
`1` – Local intranet (internal network)
`2` – Trusted sites
`3` – Internet (mostly web downloads)
`4` – Untrusted / Restricted sites (flagged as dangerous by smartscreen)

## Unblock-File

Files downloaded from the internet still getting blocked? Unblock it/them with (one of them):
```powershell
Unblock-File -Path "C:\Path\Script.ps1" -> File

dir C:\Path\*Files* | Unblock-File -> Multiple files 
```
