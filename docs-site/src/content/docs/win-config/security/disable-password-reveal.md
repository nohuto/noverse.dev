If you enable this policy setting, the password reveal button won't be displayed after a user types a password in the password entry text box. If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, the password reveal button will be displayed after a user types a password in the password entry text box. By default, the password reveal button is displayed after a user types a password in the password entry text box."

`Disable Picture Password Sign-In`: "This policy setting allows you to control whether a domain user can sign in using a picture password. If you enable this policy setting, a domain user can't set up or sign in with a picture password. If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, a domain user can set up and use a picture password. Note that the user's domain password will be cached in the system vault when using this feature."
