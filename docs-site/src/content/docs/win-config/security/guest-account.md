Guest account status policy setting determines whether the Guest account is enabled or disabled. This account allows unauthenticated network users to gain access to the system by signing in as a Guest with no password. Unauthorized users can access any resources that are accessible to the Guest account over the network. This privilege means that any network shared folders with permissions that allow access to the Guest account, the Guests group, or the Everyone group will be accessible over the network. This accessibility can lead to the exposure or corruption of data.

## Best practices

Set Guest account status to Disabled so that the built-in Guest account is no longer usable. All network users will have to authenticate before they can access shared resources on the system. If the Guest account is disabled and Network access: Sharing and security model for local accounts is set to Guest only, network logons, such as those logons performed by the SMB Service will fail.

## Vulnerability

The default Guest account allows unauthenticated network users to sign in as a Guest with no password. These unauthorized users could access any resources that are accessible to the Guest account over the network. This capability means that any shared folders with permissions that allow access to the Guest account, the Guests group, or the Everyone group are accessible over the network, which could lead to the exposure or corruption of data.
