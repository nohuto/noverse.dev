Process mitigations are system or per process exploit protections for common memory corruption & control flow attack classes. These can improve exploit resistance, but some mitigations can break older software, drivers, game anti-cheat components, launchers, or injected overlays. The mitigation tables in the sections are copied from [Windows Internals E7 P1](https://github.com/nohuto/windows-books/releases/download/7th-Edition/Windows-Internals-E7-P1.pdf), 'Exploit mitigations'.

The option currently includes the [system-level mitigations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/customize-exploit-protection#exploit-protection-mitigations).

These options are stored system wide in:
```ini
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\kernel\MitigationOptions ; REG_BINARY, 24 bytes
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\kernel\MitigationAuditOptions ; REG_BINARY, 24 bytes
```

The relevant 4 bit field uses `0` = default/not configured, `1` = force on, and `2` = force off.

| Option | [PS reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/customize-exploit-protection#powershell-reference-table) | `MitigationOptions` field | Enable bytes | Disable bytes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DEP | `DEP`, `EmulateAtlThunks` | byte `0`, low 4 bits | `01 00 00 XX` | `02 00 00 XX` |

| Validate heap integrity | `TerminateOnError` | byte `1`, high 4 bits | `00 10 00 XX` | `00 20 00 XX` |
| Mandatory ASLR | `ForceRelocateImages` | byte `1`, low 4 bits | `00 01 00 XX` | `00 02 00 XX` |
| Bottom-up ASLR | `BottomUp`, `HighEntropy` | byte `2`, low 4 bits | `00 00 01 XX` | `00 00 02 XX` |

## CFG

> "*validating the target of any indirect `CALL` or `JMP` instruction against a list of valid expected target functions*"
>
> — Windows Internals, [E7, P1: 'Exploit mitigations'](https://github.com/nohuto/windows-books/releases/download/7th-Edition/Windows-Internals-E7-P1.pdf)

| Mitigation | Use case | Enabling mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Control Flow Guard (CFG) | Validates indirect `CALL` and `JMP` targets against expected valid functions, which helps stop control-flow hijacking after memory corruption. | Requires binaries compiled and linked with `/guard:cf`, or can be requested with the CFG process-creation mitigation flag for loaded images. |
| CFG Strict Mode | Blocks libraries that were not linked with `/guard:cf` from loading into the process. | Set through `SetProcessMitigationPolicy` or the strict CFG process-creation mitigation flag. |

## DEP

> "*Marking memory regions as non-executable means that code cannot be run from that region of memory*"
>
> — Microsoft, [Data Execution Prevention](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/memory/data-execution-prevention)

| Mitigation | Use case | Enabling mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DEP: Permanent | Prevents a process from disabling DEP for itself. It mainly applies to x86 and WoW64 processes. | Set through `SetProcessMitigationPolicy`, a process-creation attribute, or `SetProcessDEPPolicy`. |
| DEP: Disable ATL Thunk Emulation | Prevents legacy ATL thunk code from executing in heap memory, even where compatibility handling would otherwise allow it. | Set through `SetProcessMitigationPolicy`, a process-creation attribute, or `SetProcessDEPPolicy`. |

## Mandatory ASLR

> "*forces a rebase of all DLLs within the process*"
>
> "*this rebasing has no entropy, and can therefore be placed at a predictable location in memory*"
>
> — Microsoft, [Exploit protection reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/exploit-protection-reference)

| Mitigation | Use case | Enabling mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ASLR Force Relocate Images | Forces rebasing for images that were not linked with `/DYNAMICBASE`. | Set through `SetProcessMitigationPolicy` or the force-relocate process-creation mitigation flag. |
| ASLR Disallow Stripped Images | Blocks libraries without relocation data when forced relocation is required. | Set through `SetProcessMitigationPolicy` or the force-relocate and require-relocations mitigation flag. |

## Bottom-up ASLR

> "*adds entropy to relocations, so their location is randomized and therefore less predictable*"
>
> — Microsoft, [Exploit protection reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/exploit-protection-reference)

| Mitigation | Use case | Enabling mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ASLR Bottom Up Randomization | Randomizes bottom-up allocations such as `VirtualAlloc` and stack bases. | Set with the bottom-up ASLR process-creation mitigation flag. |

## High-entropy ASLR

> "*adds 24 bits of entropy (1 TB of variance) into the bottom-up allocation for 64-bit applications*"
>
> — Microsoft, [Exploit protection reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/exploit-protection-reference)

| Mitigation | Use case | Enabling mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- |
| High Entropy ASLR (HEASLR) | Adds much more address-space entropy for supported 64-bit images. | Requires `/HIGHENTROPYVA` at link time or the high-entropy ASLR process-creation mitigation flag. |

## SEHOP

> "*validates the SEH chain when an exception is invoked*"
>
> "*No exception handler pointers are pointing to the stack... The exception chain ends at a known final exception handler*"
>
> — Microsoft, [Exploit protection reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/exploit-protection-reference)

| Mitigation | Use case | Enabling mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SEH Overwrite Protection (SEHOP) | Validates structured exception handler chains so overwritten handlers cannot redirect exception dispatch. It mainly applies to 32-bit and WoW64 processes. | Set through `SetProcessDEPPolicy` or the SEHOP process-creation mitigation flag. |

## Validate Heap Integrity

> "*causing the application to terminate if a heap corruption is detected*"
>
> — Microsoft, [Exploit protection reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/exploit-protection-reference)

| Mitigation | Use case | Enabling mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Heap Terminate On Corruption | Terminates the process on heap corruption instead of allowing a continuable heap exception path. This reduces exploit reliability for heap corruption bugs. | Set through `HeapSetInformation` or the heap terminate process-creation mitigation flag. |

### FTH

Used for preventing legacy or unstable applications from crashing, read through the picture below for more detailed information ([`Windows Internals 7th Edition, Part 1, Page 347`](https://github.com/nohuto/Windows-Books/releases/download/7th-Edition/Windows-Internals-E7-P1.pdf)).

In [Exploit Protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/customize-exploit-protection#powershell-reference-table) you can see the `Heap` mitigation with `TerminateOnError`, Windows Internals names the same heap termination behavior `Heap Terminate On Corruption`, so the FTH note below refers to that.

> "*causing the application to terminate if a heap corruption is detected*"

> "*disables the Fault Tolerant Heap (FTH)... by terminating the process instead*"
