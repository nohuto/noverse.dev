BCDEdit is the CL editor for the Boot Configuration Database (BCD), a registry hive under `HKLM\BCD00000000` backed by a hidden BCD file (UEFI: `\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\BCD`). The BCD replaced `boot.ini` (before Windows Vista) and stores per installation boot configuration. Each entry is a BCD object (GUID) under `Objects`, and each object has `Elements` subkeys with numeric element IDs. The `Element` value is the data that maps to a readable BCDEdit option or boot parameter. BCDEdit exposes symbolic names for objects/elements and can edit online or offline stores (`/store`), and the same data can be modified by loading the BCD hive (including remote hives).

BCDEdit is primarily used for boot troubleshooting, recovery, debugging, and security/boot behavior changes (Safe Mode, driver loading, hypervisor settings). Some may not be used on latest Windows versions anymore (e.g. HalpTscSyncPolicy, see pseudocode below).

BitLocker validates a subset of BCD settings at boot to detect security sensitive changes. The validated set can be extended or reduced via policy, and the hex value of a triggering setting is logged (event ID 523). Friendly names can be listed with `bcdedit /enum all`, but some settings have no friendly name and must be configured by hex. BCD settings are also scoped to specific boot applications (for example, `winload`, `winresume`, `bootmgr`), policy entries can be prefixed with the target application (for example, `winload:nx` or `all:locale`). When secure boot is used for integrity validation, the enhanced BCD validation profile policy is ignored, and secure boot enforces its own BCD rules.

As kind of everything else, BCD edits are also stored in the registry:
```c
HKLM\BCD00000000\Objects

// Structure
HKLM\BCD00000000\Objects\{GUID} // {GUID} depends on the object, e.g. {bootmgr}, {current}, {globalsettings}
HKLM\BCD00000000\Objects\{GUID}\Elements\XXXXXXXX // XXXXXXXX is a specific setting for the object (8 digit)
HKLM\BCD00000000\Objects\{GUID}\Elements\XXXXXXXX : Element // (REG_BINARY/REG_MULTI_SZ/REG_SZ - depends on the setting) this value includes the state of the setting
```

See all object identifiers via `bcdedit /enum all /v` (`identifier`). Note that the list below uses `{bootmgr}`, `{current}` etc. which must be replaced by the actual GUID (see block above).

Here are elements which I tracked via Procmon (taken from default store and the MS documentation), note that this doesn't show default states (see block at the buttom), instead it shows several options and their possible states:
