The `Open` buttons downloads & executes [`Autoruns`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/autoruns). It's recommended to disable all kind of autoruns in the `Logon` section that you don't need, examples:
```c
OneDrive
Spotify
Discord
Steam
WingetUI
Lghub
SecurityHealth

Microsoft Edge // preferable remove edge from the mounted image, otherwise it'll create keys/values in many different places
```

Try to minimize the amount of applications that run automatically on system startup. You can go through the other sections, but this option was created for the `Logon` section, see `Disable Scheduled Tasks`/`Disable Services`.

See your current autoruns of installed apps:
```powershell
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
```
```powershell
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
```

## Suboption

### App Archive

"Automatically archive your infrequently used apps to save storage and internet bandwidth. Your files and data will still be saved, and the app's full version will be restored on your next use if it's still available."

If enabled, the system will periodically check for such infrequently used apps. By default app archiving is turned on.

#### SystemSettings Records

Toggling the option via `Apps > Advanced app settings`:
```c
// On
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\InstallService\Stubification\S-{ID}\EnableAppOffloading    Type: REG_DWORD, Length: 4, Data: 1

// Off
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\InstallService\Stubification\S-{ID}\EnableAppOffloading    Type: REG_DWORD, Length: 4, Data: 0
```
