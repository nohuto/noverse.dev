Storage Sense deletes temporary/user files automatically, see [windows policies](https://www.noverse.dev/docs/win-config/system/disable-storage-sense/#windows-policies) for more & [disable-notifications/#registry-values](https://www.noverse.dev/docs/win-config/system/disable-notifications/#registry-values) for storage sense related notification values.

Head over to the `Policies` tab, then `StorageSense` to configure other related policies.

## SystemSettings Captures

The main storage sense toggle in `System > Storage` does the same as the `Automatic User content cleanup` in `System > Storage > Storage Sense`.
