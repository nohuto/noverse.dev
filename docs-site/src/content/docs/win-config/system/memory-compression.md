Memory compression stores infrequently accessed, private memory pages in compressed form so they occupy less physical memory, causing Windows to keep more data in RAM and reduce pagefile I/O. Whenever a process references a compressed page again, it gets decompressed which is normally faster than reading it from storage, although compression and decompression consume CPU time. 

Disable it whenever you want to avoid the `SysMain` (`Disable (SysMain Off)` suboption which causes other MMAgent features to not work too) background activity, or when your system has enough RAM (which you never completely use) as compression will unlikely happen then anyway as shown below. See '[Services/Drivers, SysMain](https://noverse.dev/docs/win-config/system/disable-services-drivers/#sysmain)' before using that suboption as it handles other features too, which are beneficial on slow disks.

Compressed pages are stored in a dedicated "Memory Compression" (`MemCompression`) process managed by the Store Manager. Note that `SysMain` includes config functions used by `MMAgent`, while the actual compression work is done by the kernel Store Manager, means for the MMAgent state to apply and report correctly, `SysMain` must be allowed to run (if not, `MemCompression` won't be created).

On systems with enough free memory, it may stay almost unused even when it's enabled, as it becomes more relevant when active/cold private pages would otherwise have to be paged out. Means its just a processes which consumes no resources, and has inactive threads:

See '[Thread Activity](https://noverse.dev/docs/windbg-notes/threads/examining-thread-activity/thread-activity/)' whenever you want to read a bit more about the column meanings.

Example:  
1. System looks for cold/rarely used data in RAM
2. It compresses that data, e.g. 24 MB -> 7 MB
3. The 17 MB saved is used for active apps
4. When the data is needed again, it's decompressed back to 24 MB

### MMAgent Cmdlet

`Enable-MMAgent -MemoryCompression` calls the `PS_MMAgent` CIM provider in `sysmain.dll`, which goes to `MmaConfigure`, sets the memory compression admin bit in the Superfetch key, may set `SysMain` to automatic start and (re)starts `SysMain` so the component state can be applied.

```c
"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Superfetch"
    AdminEnable & 0x200 // MemoryCompression requested enabled
    AdminDisable & 0x200 // MemoryCompression requested disabled
    StartedComponents & 0x200 // MemoryCompression started by SysMain
```

`0x200` = bit `9`, you can use my [bitmask calculator](https://noverse.dev/#bitmask) to see whenever that bit is set in your current `StartedComponents` data, example:

See the current memory compression state via [MMAgent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/mmagent/get-mmagent?view=windowsserver2025-ps):

```powershell
Get-MMAgent

ApplicationLaunchPrefetching : True
ApplicationPreLaunch         : True
MaxOperationAPIFiles         : 512
MemoryCompression            : True # Enabled

PageCombining                : True

```

### WinDbg

If memory compression was applied by `SysMain`, the process should exist:

```c
lkd> !process 0 0 MemCompression
PROCESS ffff9c06c430e040
    SessionId: none  Cid: 0654    Peb: 00000000  ParentCid: 0004
    DirBase: 121450000  ObjectTable: ffffb20888e79c00  HandleCount:   0.
    Image: MemCompression
```

That command was run on a 32GB RAM system (with no memory pressure), which shows again that it practically does nothing in that relation.

```c
lkd> !process ffff9c06c430e040 1
PROCESS ffff9c06c430e040
    SessionId: none  Cid: 0654    Peb: 00000000  ParentCid: 0004

The threads show whether the compression process is idle or doing work:

```c
lkd> !process ffff9c06c430e040 4
