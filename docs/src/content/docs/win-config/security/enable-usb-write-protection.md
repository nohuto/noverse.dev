Restricts write access to USB devices (read only). You can also change it with `diskpart`, by selecting the disk with `select disk` and chaning it to read only with `attributes disk set readonly` (revert it with `attributes disk clear readonly`).

Rather leave USB connection error notifications enabled, unless there's a specific reason for it.
