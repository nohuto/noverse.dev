> "*The Hyper-V hypervisor (also known as Windows hypervisor) is a type-1 (native or bare-metal) hypervisor: a mini operating system that runs directly on the host's hardware to manage a single root and one or more guest operating systems. Unlike type-2 (or hosted) hypervisors, which run on the base of a conventional OS like normal applications, the Windows hypervisor abstracts the root OS, which knows about the existence of the hypervisor and communicates with it to allow the execution of one or more guest virtual machines.*"

> "*Many third-party virtualization applications don't work together with Hyper-V. Affected applications include VMware Workstation and VirtualBox. These applications might not start virtual machines, or they may fall back to a slower, emulated mode. Many virtualization applications depend on hardware virtualization extensions that are available on most modern processors. It includes Intel VT-x and AMD-V. Only one software component can use this hardware at a time. The hardware cannot be shared between virtualization applications.*"
